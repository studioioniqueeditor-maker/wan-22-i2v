# Initial Concept
A Python-based toolkit for generating videos from images using the Wan 2.1 Image-to-Video model hosted on RunPod.

# Product Vision: VividFlow
VividFlow is a high-end toolkit and platform designed to transform static images into cinematic videos using AI. It bridges the gap between complex AI model interaction and user-friendly creative workflows.

## Target Audience
*   **Individual Content Creators:** Users seeking accessible, high-quality video generation for social media and creative projects.
*   **Developers:** Engineers looking for a robust, scriptable client to integrate Image-to-Video (I2V) capabilities into their own workflows and applications.

## Core Goals
*   **Accessible Web Interface:** A polished, intuitive single-page application for effortless video generation.
*   **Professional Batch Processing:** A powerful Python client that enables efficient processing of large image sets for power users.
*   **SaaS Foundation:** Establishing the architectural groundwork for "VividFlow," including user history, persistence, and a premium aesthetic.

## Key Features & Roadmap
*   **Advanced Parameter Control:** Granular control over motion intensity, fluidity, and frame-level settings to empower creative direction.
*   **Performance Metrics:** Real-time tracking and display of generation statistics, including spin-up (queue) time and actual synthesis duration.
*   **AI Prompt Enhancer:** Integration with Groq API (utilizing Llama-3 or Qwen) to automatically expand simple user inputs into rich, cinematic prompts for better model results.
*   **"VividFlow" Visual Identity:** A premium "Studio" feel using a Deep Charcoal/OLED Black theme, Electric Purple accents, and glassmorphism UI elements.
*   **Live Progress Experience:** Dynamic visual feedback and animations that track the generation process in real-time.
