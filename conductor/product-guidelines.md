# Product Guidelines: VividFlow

## Tone & Voice
*   **Friendly & Encouraging:** We use accessible language that demystifies AI. Instead of intimidating technical jargon, we use creative terms like "Animate Your Photo" and "Magic Video Maker" to inspire confidence in our users.
*   **Clear & Supportive:** Instructions should be direct and helpful, guiding the user through the creative process without overwhelming them.

## Visual Design & UX
*   **Abstracted Simplicity:** We prioritize intuition over technicality. Complex model parameters are mapped to user-friendly sliders like "Motion Energy" (Guidance Scale) and "Smoothness" (Steps), allowing creators to focus on the result rather than the math.
*   **The "Studio" Aesthetic:** The UI utilizes a Deep Charcoal/OLED Black theme with "Electric Purple" accents and Glassmorphism (frosted glass) elements to create a premium, high-end feel.

## Generation Experience
*   **Active Waiting Room:** We turn the generation wait into an engaging experience. 
    *   **Informative Feedback:** Users are kept in the loop with clear status updates on the specific generation stage (e.g., "Decoding latent space...").
    *   **Visual Interest:** A beautiful "building" animation or glowing skeleton loader provides visual entertainment that reflects the video being created.
*   **Functional Persistence:** Users are not tethered to the generation screen. Functional persistence via toast notifications ensures they can continue exploring or working while their video is being synthesized.
